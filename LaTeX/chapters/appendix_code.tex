\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Detailed Data Tables:} Include extensive tables of raw data, implied volatility surfaces, or specific swaption characteristics if they were too large or detailed for the main body of the text.
    \item \textbf{Code Snippets or Repository Reference:} Provide key code segments, especially for the custom gradient implementation in TensorFlow or the neural network architecture. Alternatively, a link to a public code repository (e.g., GitHub) is highly recommended.
    \item \textbf{Additional Figures/Graphs:} Present any extra visualizations of results, detailed calibration error plots, or parameter evolutions that support your main findings but were not critical for the core discussion.
    \item \textbf{Mathematical Derivations:} Include any lengthy or complex mathematical derivations that were summarized or omitted from the main text to improve readability.
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter Details:} List specific hyperparameters used for your neural network model (e.g., number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, choice of activation functions, optimizer used, learning rate schedule, batch size, number of epochs, regularization techniques).
    \item \textbf{Extensive Sensitivity Analysis Results:} If you conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, the detailed findings and plots can be placed here.
