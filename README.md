This project implements a sophisticated, end-to-end pipeline for calibrating a financial interest rate model (Hull-White) using a hybrid machine learning approach. It trains a TensorFlow Neural Network to act as a "surrogate model," learning the complex relationship between market conditions (the yield curve) and the corresponding optimal model parameters.

Instead of running a slow, iterative calibration process for each new market data point, this trained network can predict the optimal parameters almost instantly. The core innovation is the use of `tf.custom_gradient` to bridge the gap between TensorFlow's automatic differentiation and the external, non-differentiable QuantLib financial library.

The pipeline handles everything from raw data processing and financial bootstrapping to model training, validation, and results visualization.

```

### üìà Swap Curve Data

* **Location:** `data/EUR SWAP CURVE/raw/`
* **File Naming:** Files must be named with the date of the curve in `DD.MM.YYYY.xlsx` format.
* **Format:** Each `.xlsx` file must contain a table like this:

```
Term    Unit    Bid     Ask
1       MO      0.5     0.6
6       MO      0.55    0.65
1       YR      0.7     0.8
2       YR      0.9     1.0
...     ...     ...     ...
```

> The script will calculate the mid-rate as `(Bid + Ask) / 2` for each row.

### üìä Volatility Cube Data

This data represents **normal volatilities** (in basis points) for a grid of swaptions.

* **Location:** `data/EUR BVOL CUBE/xlsx/`
* **File Naming:** Must follow the same date-based naming as the swap curve files (`DD.MM.YYYY.xlsx`).
* **Format:** Each file contains interleaved rows of **Vol** (volatility) and **Strike** (in percent):

```
Expiry   Type     1YR    2YR    5YR    10YR   ...
1YR      Vol      85.5   90.1   92.3   95.7   ...
         Strike   -0.25  -0.15  0.10   0.50   ...
2YR      Vol      88.2   91.5   94.0   96.2   ...
         Strike   -0.20  -0.10  0.15   0.55   ...
...      ...      ...    ...    ...    ...    ...
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### ‚úÖ Data Preparation (Optional)

1. Preprocesses raw Excel files into a clean CSV format.
2. Bootstraps zero-coupon yield curves from the swap data.

### üß† ML Feature Preparation

* The bootstrapped zero curves become input features for the neural network.
* A `StandardScaler` is fit **only on the training set** to avoid data leakage.

### üîÑ Hybrid Training

* A custom `ResidualParameterModel` is trained.
* Loss = RMSE between QuantLib-modeled and actual market volatilities.
* Gradient is manually computed using parallelized **finite-difference approximation** via `tf.custom_gradient`.

### üß™ Validation and Output

For each day in the test set:

* Predict Hull-White parameters (`a`, `sigma`) using the trained network.
* Save parameters to:

  ```
  results/neural_network/parameters/YYYY-MM-DD.json
  ```
* Save volatility surface comparison (market vs. model) to:

  ```
  results/neural_network/predictions/YYYY-MM-DD.csv
  ```
* Generate a 3D plot of the final test day's results.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Prepare data:**

   * Place your swap and vol data in the specified folders.
2. **Edit config:**

   * Open the main script and review the `CONFIG` section.
   * Set:

     ```python
     PREPROCESS_CURVES = True
     BOOTSTRAP_CURVES = True
     ```

     for first run. Set both to `False` on future runs to save time.
3. **Tune model settings:**
   Adjust the `TF_NN_CALIBRATION_SETTINGS` dictionary to change:

   * Neural network architecture
   * Learning rates
   * Number of epochs, etc.
4. **Run script:**
   Execute the main script from your terminal.

## üöÄ Future Work & Potential Improvements

* **Systematic Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use libraries like **Optuna** or **Ray Tune**.
* **Enhanced Feature Engineering:** Add lagged volatility surfaces as input features.
* **Weighted Loss Function:** Emphasize liquid or ATM swaptions.
* **Experiment Tracking:** Integrate **MLflow** or **Weights & Biases**.
* **Deployment as an API:** Use **FastAPI** or **Flask** to serve predictions.
